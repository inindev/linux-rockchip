Subject: [PATCH 014/135] arm64: dts: rockchip: enable camera I2C interfaces
 for ROCK 5B family

Any camera related IP of the RK3588 is not yet supported and the cameras
must be handled via overlays anyways, but it is sensible to expose the
related I2C interfaces by default. This allows using i2cdetect to
investigate anything connected to the CSI connectors right now. Since
the Rockchip I2C driver implements proper power management there are no
disadvantages, if nothing is connected to the port.

Note, that the second CSI port's I2C in the Rock 5B+ and Rock 5T reuse
I2C4, which is already used by fusb302 and thus already enabled.
