Subject: [PATCH 19/59] media: dt-bindings: rk3568-vepu: Add RK3588 VEPU121

This encoder-only device is present four times on this SoC, and should
support everything the rk3568 vepu supports (so JPEG, H.264 and VP8
encoding). No fallback compatible has been added, since the operating
systems might already support RK3568 VEPU and want to avoid registering
four of them separately considering they can be used as a cluster.
