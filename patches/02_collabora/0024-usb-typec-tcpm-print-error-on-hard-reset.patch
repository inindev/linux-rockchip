Subject: [PATCH 24/53] usb: typec: tcpm: print error on hard reset

A USB-C hard reset involves removing the voltage from VBUS for some
time. So basically it has the same effect as removing the USB-C plug
for a short moment. If the machine is powered from the USB-C port and
does not have a fallback supply (e.g. a battery), this will result in
a full machine reset due to power loss.

Ideally we want to avoid triggering a hard reset on these boards. A
non-working USB-C port is probably better than unplanned reboots. But
boards with a backup supply should do the hard reset to get everything
working again.

In theory it would be enough to check the self_powered property, but
it seems the property might not be configured consistently enough in
system firmwares.

So let's start with just printing an error message when a hard reset is
triggered on systems we expect to be affected. This at least makes
debugging issues on affected systems easier without impacting unaffected
systems too much.
