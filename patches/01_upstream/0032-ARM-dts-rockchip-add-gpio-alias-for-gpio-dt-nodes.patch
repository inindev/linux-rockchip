Subject: [PATCH 32/81] ARM: dts: rockchip: add gpio alias for gpio dt nodes

Rockchip SoC TRM, SoC datasheet and board schematics always refer to
the same gpio numbers - even if not all are used for a specific board.
In order to not have to re-define them for every board add the
aliases to SoC dtsi files.
