Subject: [PATCH 46/81] arm64: dts: rockchip: add rk3588 spi aliases to soc
 dtsi

The spi controllers on rk3588 are named spi0 - spi4. Board schematics
also use these exact numbers and we want those names to also reflect
in the OS devices because everything else would just cause confusion.
Userspace spi access is a thing afterall.

To prevent each board repeating their list of spi aliases, define them
in the soc dtsi, as previous Rockchip soc like the rk356x do already.
