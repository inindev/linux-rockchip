Subject: [PATCH v7 2/6] media: dt-bindings: rockchip-vpu: Add RK3588 VPU121

RK3588 has four Hantro H1 VEPUs (encoder-only) modules and one combined
Hantro H1/G1 VPU (decoder and encoder). These are not described as
separate IP, since they are sharing an internal cache. This adds the
RK3588 specific compatible string for the combined VPU, which seems to
be identical to the version found in the RK3568.
